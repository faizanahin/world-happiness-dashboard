## How to Run the Project

### Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/world-happiness-dashboard.git
   cd world-happiness-dashboard
   ```
2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
5. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501)
6. **Explore the dashboard:**
   - Use the sidebar to filter by region and country, and interact with the visualizations.

### Run in Google Colab

1. **Open the `Happiness_Streamlit_Colab.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.**
   - You can upload the notebook to your Google Drive and open it with Colab, or use the GitHub import feature in Colab.
2. **Follow the instructions in the notebook.**
   - The notebook contains code cells to generate the `app.py` file and instructions for running Streamlit in Colab.
3. **Run the notebook cells.**
   - The notebook will create the `app.py` file and may provide a link to launch the Streamlit app using a service like `ngrok` or `streamlit` magic commands (see notebook output for details).
4. **Interact with the dashboard.**
   - Once the Streamlit app is running, follow the provided link to access the dashboard in your browser.



## Features
- **Interactive Filtering:** Filter data by region and country using the sidebar.
- **Country Details:** View detailed statistics for the selected country.
- **Bar Chart:** Visualize key indicators (Life Ladder, GDP per capita, Social Support) for the selected country.
- **Bubble Chart:** Explore the relationship between GDP per capita and happiness, with bubble size representing healthy life expectancy.
- **Modern UI:** Clean, user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit and Plotly.

## Dataset

The dashboard uses a simulated subset of world happiness data with the following columns:

| Column                          | Description                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Country name                     | Name of the country                         |
| year                             | Year of the data                            |
| Life Ladder                      | Happiness score (subjective well-being)     |
| Log GDP per capita               | Logarithm of GDP per capita                 |
| Social support                   | Perceived social support (0-1 scale)        |
| Healthy life expectancy at birth | Life expectancy in years                    |
| Region                           | Geographical region                         |

**Sample Data:**
```
Country name,year,Life Ladder,Log GDP per capita,Social support,Healthy life expectancy at birth,Region
Finland,2021,7.8,10.7,0.96,72.0,Western Europe
Denmark,2021,7.6,10.6,0.95,71.8,Western Europe
